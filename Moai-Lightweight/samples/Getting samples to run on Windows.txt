To start a sample, execute a run.bat file in sample's folder. Go ahead and try hello-moai\run.bat!

If there's a problem, it most probably means that Moai environment variables are not yet set on your system. You must add MOAI_BIN, which points to a directory where moai.exe is located. You must also add MOAI_CONFIG, which points to a directory where config.lua is located. Then restart your computer and try it again, it'll sure will work.

See example below (if this package was extracted to C:\Moai-Lightweight):

  MOAI_BIN:
  C:\Moai-Lightweight\bin\win32
  
  MOAI_CONFIG:
  C:\Moai-Lightweight\samples\config
